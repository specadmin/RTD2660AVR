# RTD2660 LCD controller driver for using with AVR MCU #

This is an open-source library for dealing with RTD2660 or RTD2662 display and OSD controllers from your AVR project. It was designed to provide a high-level interface in order to simplify developers work and to give an opportunity to design and create low-cost OSD devices with LCDs up to FullHD size.


## Hardware connections ##

RTD2660 or RTD2662 LCD controllers may be connected with an external MCU using the following schematics

## Usage example ##

A sample project is included in this repository. It demonstrates several library's methods and the result, that could be achieved, when using this library.
The following hardware was used in this sample project:
* TM060RDH01 LCD panel;
* PCB800809.V6 board with RTD2660;
* [OM-128](https://github.com/specadmin/OM-128) development board with ATmega1284p.

### Compile ###

```
git clone https://github.com/specadmin/RTD2660AVR
cd RTD2660AVR
git submodule update --init
cd sample
make
```

You may need to make some changes in [Makefile](sample/Makefile), corresponding to your hardware.



### Unpload the firmware

`make install`

This command uses `avrdude` for uploading the firmware. See Makefile for details.
